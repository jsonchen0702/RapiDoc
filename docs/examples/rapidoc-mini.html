      <h2>Introducing &lt;rapi-doc-mini&gt; Web Component </h2>
      <p> 
        <b>&lt;rapi-doc-mini&gt;</b> a new way to expose your API documentation. There are various styles and need how one would like to document their APIs. 
        such as 
        <ul>
          <li>
            All the APIs are documented in one central place. This is where <b>&lt;rapi-doc&gt;</b> fits in.
          </li>
          <li>
           Expose just a few important APIs such as authentication etc as a part of a blog, to provide an initial understanding to your audience
          </li>
          <li>
            A step by step tutorial where in each step shows you a few APIs 
          </li>
          <li>
            Or you are explaining a business case which uses microservices, 
            where each microservice has its own OpenAPI spec and the ask is to pick few APIs from each of theses microservice show how they come work together in a single document
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <h2>Usage in a bolg style writing</h2>
      <p style="flex:1">
        It is fairly common to write specifically about few APIs to provide an initial understanding to your users. 
        However in those cases you run the risk of the writeup getting outdated if the source API changes its url or schema.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>&lt;rapi-doc-mini&gt;</b> gives you this amazing capability to extract and expose any part of you Open-API spec including a built in API console to try out. 
        As an example shown below is how I am exposing a set of APIs in this writeup. 
        It is a very powerful tool that comes with many advantages, inluding syntax highlighting, built-in console, markdown support and many others. 
        Go ahead and play with the below APIs, make live request and watch the responses
      </p>
      <rapi-doc-mini
        style= "min-width:600px;"
        id = "thedoc" 
        spec-url="../specs/mock.yaml"
        theme = "light"
        schema-style = 'table'
        sort-endpoints-by = "method"
        layout = "row"
        paths-expanded = "false"
        bg-color = "#f9f9fb"
      > </rapi-doc-mini>
      <br/>
      <h3> Placement, Resize and Style</h3>
      If needed it can be resized to fit the layout needs. 
      Just like how you would use an &lt;img&gt; tag, in the same way you can use <b>&lt;rapi-doc-mini&gt;</b>
      and place and style per your needs.<br/>
      like shown below, I reduced its width, applied a thick border and attached some shadow 
      <br/><br/>
      <rapi-doc-mini
        style = "min-width:600px; width:600px; border-radius: 4px; border: 2px solid #333; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"
        id = "thedoc" 
        spec-url="../specs/mock.yaml"
        theme = "light"
        schema-style = 'table'
        sort-endpoints-by = "method"
        layout = "column"
        paths-expanded = "false"
      > </rapi-doc-mini>

      <h3>Show only whats needed </h3>
      Instead of showing entire open-api spec you can just extract and choose to show what you need to show. This is done using <b>match-paths</b> attribute.
      <br/>Example below uses the same OpeanAPi spec as we used above, but showing only the paths that we intend to
      <br/><br/>
      <rapi-doc-mini
        style= "min-width:600px; width:600px; border-radius:2px; border: 1px solid #eee; border-top-width:0"
        id = "thedoc" 
        spec-url="../specs/mock.yaml"
        theme = "light"
        schema-style = 'table'
        sort-endpoints-by = "method"
        layout = "column"
        paths-expanded = "false"
        match-paths = "post /users"
      > </rapi-doc-mini>
    <br/>

    <h3>Show it Minimzed or Expanded</h3>
    If expand/collapse is not your style, or feel it a bit of distraction then have it always expanded and make it more natural and integrated part of your writeup.
    <br> Use the attribute <b>paths-expanded = "true"</b> to achive this <br/><br/>
    <rapi-doc-mini
    style= "min-width:600px; width:600px;"
    id = "thedoc" 
    spec-url="../specs/mock.yaml"
    theme = "light"
    schema-style = 'table'
    sort-endpoints-by = "method"
    layout = "column"
    paths-expanded = "true"
    match-paths = "post /users"
    bg-color = "#f9f9fb"
  > </rapi-doc-mini>

  <h3>Include APIs from multiple specs</h3>
  <p>
    Pretty common with micro services, where you like to explain a business flow by consuming APIs from multiple services. 
    Each of these services may be having their own OpenAPI spec. 
    The ask is to pluk some APIs from different services and makeup a story. <br>
    Do not rewrite the API specific functionality again, make use of the existing OpenAPI spec and Use <b>&lt;rapi-doc-mini&gt;</b> to pluck and document APIs from differenct specs
  </p>
  <rapi-doc-mini
    style= "width:600px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #333"
    id = "thedoc" 
    spec-url="../specs/code-highlight.yaml"
    theme = "light"
    schema-style = 'table'
    sort-endpoints-by = "method"
    layout = "column"
    match-paths = "get /code"
  > </rapi-doc-mini>

  <h3>Use a different theme </h3>
  <rapi-doc-mini
    style= "width:600px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"
    id = "thedoc" 
    spec-url="../specs/petstore.json"
    theme = "dark"
    schema-style = 'table'
    sort-endpoints-by = "method"
    layout = "column"
    match-paths = "/store"
  > </rapi-doc-mini>
  
  <h3>Handling non available specs</h3>
  <rapi-doc-mini
    style= "width:600px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 16px;"
    theme = "dark"
    id = "thedoc" 
    spec-url="../specs/fake-non-existing.json"
  > </rapi-doc-mini>
  <rapi-doc-mini
    style= "width:600px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 16px;"
    theme = "light"
    id = "thedoc" 
    spec-url="../specs/fake-non-existing.json"
  > </rapi-doc-mini>
